###An approach to transform my handwriting into a font.

I decided to make a font for my upcoming portfolio based on my handwriting.
Since i create it with [Birdfont](http://birdfont.org/), it will be SIL Open Font License.
I'd like to ask you to review question and improve this font with me if it's in your interest.

Oh and i'd like to see how it's used :)
